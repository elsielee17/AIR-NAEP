12,Massachusetts,Pre-pandemic,Goal,"The stated goal for the commonwealth’s Last Mile program is to address unserved and underserved municipalities and “support the development and construction of sustainable projects for interested towns that reach at least 96% of a community’s residents and provide access to broadband speeds of 25/3 mbps, as currently defined by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).” 
The commonwealth addresses that goal through two means, through direct grants to municipalities via the Last Mile Infrastructure Grant Program (managed by the Executive Office of Housing & Economic Development) and through requests for proposals or notices of funding 
available which solicit proposals for private providers to close gaps in unserved and underserved municipalities, procurements managed by the Massachusetts Broadband Institute (MBI). 
While the MBI “remains focused on the principles announced in its May 10, 2016 Last Mile Broadband Implementation Framework,” under a program launched in October 2017 called the “Flexible Grant Program” or “FGP,” the MBI will consider variations to the 2016 framework with the consent of a participating Town.
“For broadband solutions delivered by private providers, the FGP provides MBI with the flexibility to consider alternative solutions based on a range of program criteria that may include: 
“Modifications in Coverage Requirement. While MBI remains committed to its previously stated goal of achieving at least 96% broadband coverage within each Town, MBI is willing to entertain proposals to fund Broadband Projects that will result in less than 96% coverage, if requested to do so by the Town. In these cases, MBI will work with the Provider and the Town to determine the feasibility of implementing a phased approach to achieving 96% coverage over time. … 
“Modifications in Sources of Project Funding: MBI will entertain project financing arrangements that incorporate the investment of municipal funds, if requested to do so by the Town.”","Pre-pandemic Goal: The stated goal for the commonwealth’s Last Mile program is to address unserved and underserved municipalities and “support the development and construction of sustainable projects for interested towns that reach at least 96% of a community’s residents and provide access to broadband speeds of 25/3 mbps, as currently defined by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).”

Emergency Broadband Investment: This initiative allocates $20 million to establish a reimbursement program for broadband providers. It will assist providers with construction costs for new broadband expansion to households with students or vulnerable populations. By November of 2020, this program plans to make more than 10,000 new connections in unserved and underserved areas of the state.

Telehealth: $5.25 million will support connectivity for telehealth services for vulnerable populations. In partnership with Missouri Telehealth Network, located with the University of Missouri – Columbia’s School of Medicine, more than 12,500 hotspots will be secured for use by the Federally Qualified Health Centers and the Community Mental Health Centers.

Libraries: The Office of the State Librarian within the Secretary of State’s office will deploy $2.5 million to implement and administer a grant program for Missouri’s libraries to access resources for hotspots and Wi-Fi enabled devices to support telehealth and students of higher education.

K-12 Distance Learning: The Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education will allocate $10 million of the Coronavirus Relief Fund to Local Education Agencies (LEAs) to seek reimbursement for eligible costs to increase student connectivity.

Higher Education Distance Learning: The Department of Higher Education and Workforce Development will allocate $10 million of the Coronavirus Relief Fund to public institutions to upgrade the campus broadband networks, offer students access to Wi-Fi enabled devices or hotspots, and enhance learning management systems. 

Broadband Technical Assistance Request: The Missouri Association of Councils of Government (MACOG) and DED have partnered together to apply for nearly $615,000 in grant support from the Economic Development Administration (EDA) to support a pilot project for Broadband Modeling and Engineering Feasibility Plans for up to 24 counties or 8 regional clusters.","Pandemic Fund: The expansion includes several new initiatives.
